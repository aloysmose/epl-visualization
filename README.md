# English Premier League Players Nationality Data Visualization Project
This project uses data pulled from the <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/">Official Premier League Website</a> 
and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a> to visualize the nationality of EPL players.  All logos were pulled from <a href="https://www.fmscout.com/a-fm18-logos-premier-league-2017-18.html">FM SCOUT</a>.<br>
