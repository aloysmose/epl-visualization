# English Premier League Players Nationality Data Visualization Project
This project uses a modified version of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mauryashubham/english-premier-league-players-dataset">English Premier League Players Dataset, 2017/18</a> 
and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a> to visualize the nationality of EPL players.  All logos were pulled from <a href="https://www.fmscout.com/a-fm18-logos-premier-league-2017-18.html">FM SCOUT</a>.<br>
<br>
Currently the project is in it's beta stage so expect a few bugs.
